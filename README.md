Overview of the project

Project: TEMPERATURE CONVERTER USING C PROGRAMMING
The objective of this code is to create a temperature conversion program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

The key activities of this code are:

1. User input: The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the scale it is in (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).

2. Conversion: The program uses a switch statement to determine which conversion to perform based on the user's input. It then applies the appropriate conversion formula to convert the temperature to the desired scale.

3. Output: The program prints the converted temperature value and the scale it is in.

The key activities can be broken down into the following steps:

- Get user input (temperature value and scale)
- Determine which conversion to perform (Celsius to Fahrenheit, Celsius to Kelvin, Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.)
- Apply the appropriate conversion formula
- Print the converted temperature value and scale.

EDA Platform used is VS CODE
